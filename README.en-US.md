## Introduction

**A Raw Gemstone Awaiting Polishing**

The Jade version of the x-lik game framework is a raw gemstone, awaiting its final polish. It is a testament to the company's commitment to providing a platform for game developers to explore and experiment with their own ideas. Like a jade stone, the framework is not yet fully refined, but it offers a blank canvas for developers to create their own unique game experiences.

The Jade version of x-lik game framework is completely full open-source, allowing developers to access and modify the codebase. However, it retains its core functionality modules, ensuring that the foundation of the framework remains stable and reliable. Developers are free to develop their own custom functionality modules, tailoring the framework to their specific needs.

It is ideal for developers who are passionate about exploring and researching their own ideas. It provides a blank canvas for developers to experiment with new concepts and techniques, pushing the boundaries of game development. Empowers developers to bring their vision to life. This repository will only receive necessary maintenance and updates.
